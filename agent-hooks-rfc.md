# Summary

[summary]: #summary

This RFC proposes adding Agent hooks to Amazon Q CLI, enabling users to define natural language cause-and-effect relationships that automatically trigger actions during query processing. These hooks allow for persistent automation of repetitive tasks without requiring explicit commands each time.

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Users often have recurring patterns in their workflows where certain actions should automatically follow specific events. For example:
- Updating README.md when code in a specific folder changes
- Running tests when a function is modified
- Generating documentation when new modules are added
- Enforcing code style or security checks when files are created or modified

Currently, users must remember to perform these actions manually or set up complex automation outside of Q CLI. By integrating agent hooks directly into Q CLI, we can:

1. Reduce cognitive load on users by automating repetitive tasks
2. Ensure consistency in workflows by automatically applying best practices
3. Leverage natural language processing to make automation accessible without complex scripting
4. Provide a seamless experience where Q CLI proactively assists based on user-defined patterns

## Defining Agent Hooks

Agent hooks are defined using natural language statements that describe a cause and an effect. The basic syntax is:

```
q hook create "When [cause], then [effect]"
```

For example:
```
q hook create "When any file in src/components is created or modified, then update README.md with the new component information"
```

## Listing and Managing Hooks

Users can list, view, edit, and delete their hooks:

```
q hook list
q hook show <hook-id>
q hook edit <hook-id> "When [new-cause], then [new-effect]"
q hook delete <hook-id>
```

## Hook Activation

Hooks are automatically activated when Q CLI detects that the cause condition has been met during normal operation. For example, if the user runs a command that modifies a file in `src/components`, Q CLI will:

1. Detect the file change event
2. Match it against registered hooks
3. Execute the effect action (updating README.md)
4. Notify the user that the hook was triggered

## Hook Notification and Control

Users can control how hooks are executed:

```
q hook config --notification=always|important-only|never
q hook config --auto-execute=always|ask|never
q hook disable <hook-id>
q hook enable <hook-id>
```

## Example Use Cases

1. **Documentation Maintenance**:
   ```
   q hook create "When code in lib/ changes, then update API documentation"
   ```

2. **Testing Workflow**:
   ```
   q hook create "When test files are modified, then run the affected tests"
   ```

3. **Project Standards**:
   ```
   q hook create "When new JavaScript files are created, then ensure they have proper header comments"
   ```

4. **Dependency Management**:
   ```
   q hook create "When package.json is modified, then check for security vulnerabilities"
   ```

## System Architecture

The agent hooks system consists of several components:

1. **Hook Parser**: Converts natural language hook definitions into structured representations
2. **Event Monitor**: Detects file system and command events that might trigger hooks
3. **Matcher Engine**: Determines if an event satisfies a hook's cause condition
4. **Action Executor**: Performs the effect action when a hook is triggered
5. **Persistence Layer**: Stores hook definitions across sessions

### Hook Representation

Internally, hooks are represented as:

```rust
struct Hook {
    id: String,
    cause: Condition,
    effect: Action,
    enabled: bool,
    created_at: DateTime,
    last_triggered: Option<DateTime>,
}

enum Condition {
    FileEvent(FileEventCondition),
    CommandEvent(CommandEventCondition),
    TimeEvent(TimeEventCondition),
    // Other condition types
}

enum Action {
    FileModification(FileModificationAction),
    CommandExecution(CommandExecutionAction),
    Notification(NotificationAction),
    // Other action types
}
```

### Natural Language Processing

The hook parser uses NLP techniques to extract:

1. **Event type**: File creation, modification, deletion, command execution, etc.
2. **Target**: Files, directories, or commands affected
3. **Constraints**: Additional conditions like file types or content patterns
4. **Action**: What should happen when the condition is met

For example, parsing "When any Python file in src/ is modified, then run unit tests" would extract:
- Event: File modification
- Target: Python files in src/
- Action: Run unit tests

### Event Detection

The system monitors relevant events through:

1. File system watchers for file events
2. Command interception for command events
3. Periodic checks for time-based events

### Hook Execution Flow

1. User performs an action (e.g., edits a file)
2. Event Monitor detects the action and creates an Event object
3. Matcher Engine compares the Event against all enabled hooks
4. For each matching hook:
   a. If auto-execute is enabled, Action Executor performs the effect
   b. Otherwise, user is prompted for confirmation
5. Results and notifications are displayed to the user

### Persistence

Hooks are stored in a JSON file in the Q CLI configuration directory:

```
~/.config/q-cli/hooks.json
```

## Integration Points

The agent hooks system integrates with:

1. **Q CLI Command System**: For registering hook management commands
2. **File System Monitoring**: For detecting file events
3. **Command Execution**: For intercepting and executing commands
4. **NLP Pipeline**: For parsing natural language hook definitions
5. **Notification System**: For alerting users about hook triggers

# Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

1. **Complexity**: Adds significant complexity to the Q CLI system
2. **Performance Impact**: Continuous monitoring for hook triggers could impact performance
3. **Ambiguity**: Natural language processing may misinterpret user intentions
4. **Security Concerns**: Automatic execution of actions could pose security risks
5. **Learning Curve**: Users need to learn how to effectively define hooks

# Rationale and alternatives

[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

## Why This Design?

1. **Natural Language Interface**: Makes automation accessible to users without scripting knowledge
2. **Integration with Existing Q CLI**: Leverages the existing NLP capabilities of Q
3. **Flexible Trigger System**: Supports various types of events and conditions
4. **User Control**: Provides options for notification and execution preferences

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Git Hooks**: Limited to Git operations and requires scripting knowledge
2. **External Automation Tools**: Requires users to learn and set up separate systems
3. **Rule-Based System with Formal Syntax**: More precise but less user-friendly
4. **Event-Driven Programming Model**: More powerful but significantly more complex

## Impact of Not Doing This

Without agent hooks:
1. Users continue to manually perform repetitive tasks
2. Inconsistent application of best practices
3. Higher cognitive load on users to remember workflow steps
4. Missed opportunity to differentiate Q CLI with proactive assistance

# Unresolved questions

3. How should conflicts between multiple matching hooks be resolved?
4. What security measures are needed to prevent malicious hook definitions?
5. How should hooks handle errors during execution?
